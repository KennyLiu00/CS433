Grading comment:
Most variables should have a brief comment explaining their purpose. Looping control variables such as: “x” or “i” need not be commented.

Grading comment:
Comment your code to explain tricky and important points (not every line).

applied rubric item
+ 2 pts
Grading comment:
Comments should be comprehensible and useful. Comments such as: “This adds 1 to Count” are trivial and should be avoided.

Report Writing

applied rubric item
+ 4 pts
Grading comment:
4 - Exemplary: Flow smoothly, effective in using strong topic sentences to start paragraphs, transitions to link sentences, a varied sentence structure, and logical connections between ideas. Demonstrates thorough proofreading. Defines all high-tech terms (acronyms or abbreviations); Uses highlighting techniques appropriately to emphasize main points to help information accessibility; clear cross-references.

+ 3 pts
Grading comment:
3 - Satisfactory: Effective in sentence structure and very good in logical flow. Appears to have been proofread, but further revision could improve the text. Most main points are highlighted and explained; acronyms are usually defined.

+ 2 pts
Grading comment:
2 - Developing: Uses varied sentence structures but lacks transitions to link sentences and paragraphs in many places. Proofreading appears to have been done hastily. Some main points are highlighted but rarely explained; acronyms are used without definition.

+ 1 pt
Grading comment:
1 - Unsatisfactory: Almost no paragraph stays on topic, uses simple sentences and repetitive sentence structure. Does not appear to have proofread (Numerous errors in punctuation, spelling, grammar). Text is unintelligible; Highlighting techniques (tables, figures, headings, different font styles and sizes, etc.) are not used or never explained
