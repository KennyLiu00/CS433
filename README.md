# CS433 Operating Systems

*COURSE DESCRIPTION*

This course examines fundamental issues in operating system design and implementation. The
operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user
programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run. The course will cover the
major components of modern operating systems. Topics include process management (processes,
threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation,
paging, swapping), file systems, and security. The course will provide essential building blocks to
construct complex, real-world software systems.

**STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES (SLOS)**

After taking this course, students should be able to...

	• Explain modern operating systems' objectives and functions and analyze the inherent tradeoffs in OS design.

	• Contrast kernel and user mode in an operating system and discuss the values of interrupt processing, system calls, and APIs.

	• Describe the difference between processes and threads.

	• Compare and contrast process communications using shared memory and message passing.

	• Compare and contrast the common algorithms used for scheduling tasks in operating systems.

	• Demonstrate the potential run-time problems arising from the concurrent operation of many separate tasks and summarize techniques for achieving synchronization in an operating system.

	• Describe the causes of deadlocks and approaches to handle them.

	• Compare and contrast the different ways of allocating memory to tasks.

	• Summarize the principles and evaluate the performance of virtual memory.

	• Compare and contrast different approaches to file system design and implementation.
